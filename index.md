Hi hello! People usually call me M. I go by he/they and am 19 years old.

I do lots of silly things in my free time :3 - low level programming stuff, radio stuff, and some electronics (although I'm terrible at electronics).

### Interests:
- **Programming**
  - C, C++ (I usually use C++ but don't use most of its features)
  - Python
  - Rust
  - Assembly for various Architectures
  - C# (pretty much my first language, I haven't touched it in years)
  - PHP (didn't touch it in years either)
- **Radio Stuff**
  - I especially like the very high and very low ends of the radio spectrum, VLF and Optical comms.
- **Electronics**
  - Goes together with the radio stuff pretty much.
