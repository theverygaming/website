Hi hello! People usually call me M [(pronounced /'É›m/)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LL-Q1860_(eng)-Flame,_not_lame-M.wav). I go by she/they and am 20 years old.

I do lots of silly things in my free time :3 - I mainly dabble with computers, do radio stuff, and some electronics (although I'm terrible at electronics).

### Interests:
- **Computer stuff in general**
  - Older computers sometimes
  - Linux <!-- TODO: linux journey blogpost sometime maybe -->
  - Kubernetes - i run a small k3s cluster at home
  - NixOS
- **Programming**
  - C, C++ (I usually use C++ but don't use most of its features)
  - Python
  - Rust
  - Assembly for various Architectures
  - C# (pretty much my first language, I haven't touched it in years)
  - PHP (didn't touch it in years either)
- **Radio Stuff**
  - VLF (mainly stuff below 8.3kHz)
  - Optical - literally light - sadly it's a little hard to find people to have a QSO with at those frequencies
  - I chase/retrieve radiosondes (and you should too!) - see [a talk about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBy-bXEWZeM)
- **Electronics**
  - I make attempts at building some circuits sometimes, but usually fail

Sometimes i play games too (usually whenever I'm demotivated and not feeling like doing anything productive), like 90% of the time it's Counter-Strike 2 though. And I'm not even good at it.

Also even more rarely i watch Anime :3
