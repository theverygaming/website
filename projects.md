I projecthop _a lot_ and I probably won't update this page at any reasonable frequency. If you want to know what I'm currently working on check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/theverygaming)

This is a small subset of my projects, which I think are interesting enough to mention here

- Fantasy computer with a custom CPU Architecture called [Funnyarch](https://github.com/theverygaming/funnyarch) (until I find a better name). [There is a emulator for it that runs in your browser](/projects/funnyarch.html)!!
- Vix, a kernel that is supposed to be binary compatible with Linux at _some point_. [Take a look on GitHub](https://github.com/theverygaming/vix)!

And plenty of other projects.. Ask me about them!! :3
